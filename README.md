`Shh` is a password manager that i build so i don't have to search for my passwords all day long.

## How is it working?

1. You define your path to the db file & your secret encryption key in your .env file.
2. The database is going the be automatically created at specified path.
3. Each password is automatically encrypted.
4. When you retrieve credentials for a particular site the password it's decrypted and the password is automatically copied to your clipboard, ready for you to paste it where you need it.

## Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies running: `./install_dependencies.sh`.
2. Follow `.env.example` and set your environmental variables in your `.env` file.
3. You are all set! Now start using the cli to manage your passwords.

## Usage Examples

```bash
shh gmail mypass123 # set a password for gmail
shh gmail # copy to clipboard the password you set for gmail
shh gmail newpass # update the password for gmail
```
